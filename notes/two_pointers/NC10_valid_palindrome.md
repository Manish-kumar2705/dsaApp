Here are the detailed DSA notes for the LeetCode problem: Valid Palindrome (Pattern: Two Pointers):

## Problem Statement and Examples
Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a palindrome, or `false` otherwise. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring cases and non-alphanumeric characters.

Examples:

* Input: `s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"` Output: `true` (ignoring cases and non-alphanumeric characters)
* Input: `s = "race a car"` Output: `false`
* Input: `s = " "` Output: `true` (empty string is a palindrome)

## Hints
1. **Ignore non-alphanumeric characters**: Focus on alphanumeric characters (letters and digits) and ignore the rest.
2. **Handle case insensitivity**: Convert the string to lowercase or uppercase to ignore case differences.
3. **Use two pointers**: Initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the string, and move them towards each other to check for palindrome.

## Intuition
The core idea is to use two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the string, to check if the string is a palindrome. We can ignore non-alphanumeric characters and handle case insensitivity by converting the string to lowercase or uppercase. By moving the pointers towards each other, we can efficiently check if the string is a palindrome.

## General Solution for Pattern
The Two Pointers pattern is commonly used in problems that require checking for symmetry or palindrome in a string or array. The general approach is to:

* Initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the string or array.
* Move the pointers towards each other, checking for the desired condition (e.g., palindrome, symmetry).
* If the condition is met, return true; otherwise, return false.

Common use cases include:

* Checking for palindrome in a string or array.
* Finding the middle element of a sorted array.
* Checking for symmetry in a matrix.

## Brute-Force Approach
A brute-force approach would be to generate all possible substrings of the input string and check if each substring is a palindrome. This approach has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the length of the input string, making it inefficient for large inputs.

## Optimal Solution Breakdown
The optimal solution uses the Two Pointers pattern to efficiently check for palindrome in the input string.

* Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
* Space complexity: O(1), since we only use a few extra variables to store the pointers and the converted string.

Edge cases:

* Empty string: Return true, as an empty string is a palindrome.
* Single-character string: Return true, as a single-character string is a palindrome.

Optimizations:

* Convert the input string to lowercase or uppercase to handle case insensitivity.
* Use two pointers to efficiently check for palindrome.

## Code (Java)
```java
public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
    // Convert the input string to lowercase to handle case insensitivity
    s = s.toLowerCase();

    // Initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the string
    int left = 0;
    int right = s.length() - 1;

    // Move the pointers towards each other, checking for palindrome
    while (left < right) {
        // Ignore non-alphanumeric characters
        while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(left))) {
            left++;
        }
        while (left < right && !Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(right))) {
            right--;
        }

        // Check if the characters at the pointers are equal
        if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) {
            return false;
        }

        // Move the pointers towards each other
        left++;
        right--;
    }

    // If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, return true
    return true;
}
```
Note: The code uses the `Character.isLetterOrDigit()` method to check if a character is alphanumeric.
